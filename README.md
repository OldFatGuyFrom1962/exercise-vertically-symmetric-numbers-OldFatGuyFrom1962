# Numbers with 180 Degree Rotational Symmetry

In this exercise you'll find all numbers of a certain length 
that are symmetric when rotated 180 degrees. 
This means the numbers read the same 
when flipped top to bottom and reversed. For the purposes of this exercise
we'll assume that a "6" is an upside down "9" and that 0, 8, and 1
are all symmetrical vertically. 

For instance, the two-digit numbers with this symmetry are 88, 11, 69, and
96. 

Note that numbers with leading zero should not be counted. For instance,
"010" is not a valid vertically symmetrical number of length 3.

Update this readme with the answers to the following table:

| Number Length  | Number of Vertically Symmetrical Numbers  |
|---|---|
| 1  | ?  |
| 2  | 4  |
| 3  | ?  |
| 5  | ?  |
| 10 | ?  |
